I was born in Brazil, and I currently live in Australia. I have been working in technology since 2011. I started my career as a developer, supporting and developing projects for large companies worldwide, from the configuration of the web application to the mobile application.
I graduated with a major in systems analysis and development at the Catholic Church of Santa Catarina, where I awakened my interest and curiosity for programming.
Since then, I have become a full-stack developer working in front-end and back-end applications using Javascript.
I am always looking for new ways to improve my knowledge and deepen my research in my field of work. I follow the same path as the technology, renewing myself every moment.
