I'm from Brazil and I currently living in Sydney, Australia. Iâ€™m working with technology since 2011.
I started my career in the developer area, supported and developed projects for large companies in Brazil. From the configuration of web apps to mobile applications.

I graduated in Analysis and development of systems by Catholic of Santa Catarina, where from then I awoke the interest and curiosities in programming.

Since then I have become a full-stack developer, developing frontend and backend applications exclusively in Javascript. I am currently focused on the React / React-Native ecosystem for frontend and Node for backend applications.
I'm always looking for new ways to improve my knowledge and new studies about the area in which I work. I follow the same line as technology, renewing myself every moment.
